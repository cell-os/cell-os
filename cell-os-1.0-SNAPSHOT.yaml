# The CellOS version bundle captures the necessary module versions that are developed,
# tested and certified to work together.
# The modules are a [partially ordered set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) 
# The order is defined by the level of dependency. 
# For example Docker is low level running directly on the OS and other modules depend on it
